As I've increasingly integrated VSCode into my daily development routine, 
I've embarked on exploring other platforms such as the JetBrains ecosystem, 
alongside my ongoing experimentation with Jupyter IDE. While I remain devoted 
to VIM with plugins, including essentials like CTags and NerdTree, which have 
served me well for years, I've found it worthwhile to broaden my horizons. 

While I once shied away from tools like IntelliJ and VisualStudio, my prior 
experiences using them in different roles have fostered a newfound openness. 
The realization of how limiting my previous perspective was has transformed 
into a valuable learning opportunity. 

As I continue to delve into various IDEs and development environments, I'm 
embracing the chance to enhance my productivity and expand my skill set.
